	<h1>A Sacrifice Behind a Success</h1>
	<h3>By Mikaela Chelli C. Tapang</h3>
</div>
<div class="Paragraphs">
<p id="Paragraph1">In every victory, there is resiliency<br>
The ability to arise and sacrifice<br>
No matter what may take<br>
The extra mile we are willing to make</p>

<p class="Paragraph2">In this sacrifice, it is evident that we should be benevolent<br>
Towards everyone, everything, and our self<br>
In extending our mission to help, we are united<br>
Different Filipinos like-minded not divided</p>

<p class="Paragraph3">We are continuously fulfilling<br>
Our fellow Filipinosâ€™ hopes and dreams<br>
Ensuring that what they have been longing for<br>
Can be achieved neither distant nor far</p>

<p class="Paragraph4">Though at times we may run in circles<br>
We remain steadfast against these hurdles<br>
For we are not weak<br>
And we can definitely reach the peak</p>

<p class="Paragraph5">The end of this battle is yet to come<br>
And there will be storms and moments of calm<br>
But we shall proudly take home the prize of excellence<br>
As a mark of our unwavering resilience</p>
